//Tokens : are smallest unit of programme

1.keyword:which is having predefined meaning
like if, while, else...

2.Identifier : is a names that are given for class, method,object..
rules:They can have alphabets, digits, underscore and dollar symbol
They must not begin with digit
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
whitespace characters are also not allowed

3.literals constant like 99,9.5,100...
4.operators like +,-,*,&&,||...
5.special symbols like (),[],{},...


//Nameing conventions
Names of packages-> small letters
class,interface-> each word of class interface start with capital letter  like DataInput,StringName
variables and method-> first word small letter second word capital like readLine(),nextLine()
constants-> all in capital letter
keywords-> all in small letter

•A package represents a sub directory that contains a group of classes and interfaces. Names of packages in Java are written in small letters
•Each word of class names and interface names start with a capital letter 
(String, DataInputStream, ActionListener etc.)
•The first word of a variable and method name is in small letters; then from second word onwards, each new word starts with a capital letter               
(readLine( ), nextInt( ) )
•Constants represent fixed values that cannot be altered. Such constants should be written by using all capital letters
All keywords should be written by using all small letters






//type casting 
the process of converting the value of one data type into another
1.implicit type casting:(widening)
-smaller data type to larger data type
-it is done by compiler automatically
2.explicit type casting:(narrowing)
-larger data type to smaller data type
-carried out by programmer using casting
- data lose occarnce
